## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**
  - Utilizes the Algerian Forest Fires dataset, covering two regions and multiple weather/fire indices.
  - Includes data cleaning, preprocessing, missing value handling, and region annotation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Provides detailed statistical summaries and visualizations.
  - Feature engineering with new columns for region and derived features.
- **Machine Learning Workflow**
  - Prepares and processes datasets for modeling.
  - Contains model artifacts, such as LassoCV regression models and scalers, for Fire Weather Index (FWI) prediction.
- **Interactive Web Application**
  - Flask web interface for inputting features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, rain, and fire indices.
  - Real-time prediction of FWI based on user inputs.
- **Reproducible Notebooks**
  - Well-documented Jupyter Notebooks for EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning.
  - Step-by-step code for data loading, transformation, and analysis.
- **Extensible Template Structure**
  - Organized template files for home and index pages, facilitating future UI updates.
- **Model Storage**
  - Pre-trained models and scalers stored in the `models/` directory for deployment and reuse.
